I decided it was finally time to make my own website. For years I have simply been hiding behind my Tumblr, [9-bits](http://9-bits.com), but I wanted a home for some basic info on me and some of the projects I work on.

## Tools and frameworks being used:

* HTML5 Boilerplate: http://html5boilerplate.com/
* Spine: http://spinejs.com/
* Compass: http://compass-style.org/
* Compass Recipes: https://github.com/senchalabs/compass-recipes
